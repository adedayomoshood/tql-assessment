# Pipeline Frontend Assessment
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/c03037456a314885b48609ebae1f6819)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/adedayomoshood/tql-assessment?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=adedayomoshood/tql-assessment&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

This is a frontend assessment built by Adedayo Moshood, in the TalentQL Pipeline Application.

The task is to build a simple frontend app for paginated data, that does the following

1.  Fetches data from `https://randomapi.com/api/8csrgnjw?key=LEIX-GF3O-AG7I-6J84` which can be paged by appending `&page=N` where N is the page you want to fetch. E.g appending `&page=1` retrieves the first page, while `&page=4` retrieves the 4th page.

2.  Displays the fetched data in a HTML table with 5 rows (the API only returns 5 records), and allows the user to page next/previous with buttons in the UI
